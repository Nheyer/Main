# genomics_scripts
## These are python(2/3) and  bash  based scripts that are usfull in analying complex genomic regions
There are many unfinnished and unpollished scripts in this repositiory
That being said, and script that has a version higher then 1.x.x are well documented, and have worked well in my work
many of the scripts have their default values optimised to work with the NOTCH2NL gene famaly, and the defaults will thus
likely not be optimal for other aplications
